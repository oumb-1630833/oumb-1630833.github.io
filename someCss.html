            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <p style="font-family:courier;">My name is Belldandy Linda Oum. I was born and raised in Tacoma, Washington. I am a senior at the University of Washington studying Public Health-Global Health. When I applied to the major, I was not sure what I was signing myself up for. I did not have a lot of knowledge about what exactly "public health" meant. I have learned a lot about public health once admitted into the program. I learned that there is a wide range of opportunity to fall into within public health, which seems a bit daunting with so many choices. </p>
            <p>Due to COIVD-19, there is a greater need for those studying public health. During these uncertain times, it has made me realized how important public health is in United States. There are many programs and plans that are put in place to ensure the upmost best public health practices for everyone. With that said, I am still unsure about what I want to do with public health since I will be trying to enter the job field with only a bachelors degree. </p>
